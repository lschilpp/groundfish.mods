This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
7+5*(4+3)
exp(-5*(0.2+0.15))
(sqrt(1+2*(3+2)))/(log(3^2 + 2))
#2
a <- seq(from = 1, to = 99)
b <-seq(from = 1, to = 99, by = 2)
c <-rep(1:3, times = 3)#not sure
d <-rep(-5:-3, times = 3)
e <-seq(1:10)^-1
f <-seq(1:6)^3
#3
y <- c(3,2,15,-1,22,1,9,17,5)
y[1]#first value of y
y[9]#last value of y
l <- length(y)
y[l]#last value of vector of length l
y[y>mean(y)]#values greater than mean
which(y>mean(y))#indicies of greater than mean
any(y<0)#this returns that there are some negative values
any(y==mean(y))#there are no values equal to the mean
any(y==median(y))#there are values equal to the median

#4
library(MASS)
head(hills, n = 5)#displays first 5 hills
min(hills$time) #displays fastest time




```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
